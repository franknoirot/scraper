    "Being a global nomad, and while transitioning into the Internet at the outset of my career, my lifelong objective was ‘to travel through my work’…to be able to experience ‘cultures’ through the individuals with whom I collaborate. I think what this boils down to is to having the capability to consistently learn, and that is ultimately what n e t a allows for through both its client and team-centric approach to growth and development."
