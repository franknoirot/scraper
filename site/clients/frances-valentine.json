Today, entering the market is noticeably different; there is the landscape of <strong><a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/ecommerce/\">eCommerce</a></strong>&nbsp;centered around traffic, customer acquisition from varied online and offline sources, converting customers, establishing customer loyalty and leveraging traditional wholesale partnerships as a means of marketing, in addition to distribution in order to successfully drive brand awareness.</p><p>Our 1st&nbsp;objective in our <strong><a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/strategy/\">strategic planning</a></strong> with the original founders of Kate Spade New York, was to ensure that the introduction of Frances Valentine via francesvalentine.com was successful in communicating a brand that centered around shoes as opposed to handbags; that it highlighted the origins of its famous founders and promoted their collective commitment to quality centered around Italian manufacturers as a quality differentiator. There was equal prominence in an effort to&nbsp;leverage significant press culled from <strong><a href=\"https://francesvalentine.com/about/press/ultra-covetable-italian-made-shoes-and-bags/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vogue</a>, <a href=\"https://francesvalentine.com/about/press/wwd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WWD</a></strong>, and ensuring that FV was capturing fashionistas’ attention, who were eagerly awaiting the debut of Kate, Andy, Elyce and Paola’s 1st&nbsp;collection in nearly a decade, in order to meet eCommerce channel projections tied to its Valentine’s Day debut.</p>"
