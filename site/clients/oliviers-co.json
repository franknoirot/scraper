Given Olivier’s success in bringing Provencal beauty to the global market<em>, </em>it wasn’t long before Oliviers &amp; Co. had grown to 65 boutiques worldwide, and had expanded its product line to include gourmet delicacies that were not just representative of esteemed European chef’s palettes, but also regionally focused catering to the 18 international markets it had expanded into within a decade. O&amp;Co. won awards for the quality of its products, its branding and was world-famous for a boutique experience that felt like stepping into Provence and when you left you had tasted the Mediterranean.</p><p>Like many European companies however, O&amp;Co. was late to the eCommerce game; coupled with limited brand visibility in the United States and limited marketing dollars, O&amp;CO.’s reputation was not near its acclaim in Europe. The Franchisee who retained us, did so to help facilitate this now French behemoth into the digital era. &nbsp;While Oliviersandco.com made its debut in 2005, and climbed to the 2nd highest producing door in the United States, (2nd only to NYC’s Grand Central’s food court boutique), without corporate support from France, it proved a difficult feat to garner support for a re-positioning and evolving oliviersandco.com to reach its full online growth potential.</p>"
