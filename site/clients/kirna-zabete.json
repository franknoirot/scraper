Given the landscape of retail, KZ had a multitude of directions, partnership opportunities and strategies, to be prioritized in order to optimize their growth potential. So, through our <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/strategy/\"><strong>strategy consulting</strong></a>&nbsp;and <strong><a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/omnichannel/\">omnichannel strategy</a>&nbsp;</strong>services, we set out to lay the context of KZ’s growth trajectory and cleared a path to execute.</p><h2>Leverage a national partnership with Target to drive brand visibility, create new audiences and tie into the hi-low fashion trend.</h2><p>N e t a began its partnership with Kirna Zabête by brokering the first specialty store or licensed designer partnership to sell and distribute Kirna Zabête’s collection for Target, specifically through their own points of distribution: their SoHo boutique and kirnazabete.com. To support a dramatically different price point, we projected Kirna Zabête’s initial P.O. (and actually projected within 1% of its online sell-thru!). As part of our <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/ecommerce/\"><strong>eCommerce strategy</strong></a> to capitalize on the&nbsp;online opportunity, we designed a <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/ecommerce/\"><strong>Magento</strong></a> eCommerce pop-up shop that could be re-purposed for future partnerships such as an upcoming footwear partnership with 9 West. In addition to the contract negotiation and ownership of the project in accord with Target’s brand standards, we produced both Kirna Zabête’s street-style photo shoot and their 1st&nbsp;model-based ecommerce product shoot.</p><p>As part of our <strong><a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/omnichannel/\">omnichannel</a></strong> strategy to maximize visibility and the 6B media impressions anticipated for Target’s marketing dollars into the partnership, <span class=\"netamorphosis\">neta</span> created the first ever layover email name capture form to fully capitalize on TV advertising and the back cover of the September issue of Vogue.&nbsp; Once we had captured more than 8,000 new email addresses supporting the lower price point and broader fashion base versus KZ’s luxury clientele, we tailored KZ’s email marketing templates to support the new hi-low customer and merchandise mix, strengthening conversion metrics along the way.</p>"
