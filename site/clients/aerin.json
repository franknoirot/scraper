At the time of introduction, AERIN, as a brand, made a commitment to AERIN.com, becoming its flagship. They had already selected the robust Demandware (now part of SalesForce) eCommerce platform, information architecture and graphic front-end design were in process with previously retained 3rd Party agencies. No back-end system (OMS, ERP), fulfillment strategy or center, payment processing or marketing (beyond in-house PR) had yet been fully planned, selected or negotiated.</p><h2>Our challenge &amp;&nbsp;opportunity</h2><p>Our initial challenge presented in our eCommerce strategy was getting AERIN.com to launch, within aggressive timeline expectations that were heightened by a global brand launch. This opportunity led to becoming a trusted strategic and metrics driven partner who helped AERIN.com achieve a 163% 3-Year CAGR, and for AERIN.com to be the # 1 door.</p><h2>Bringing Aerin’s vision to launch.</h2><p>The first challenge presented in our <strong><a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/ecommerce/\">eCommerce</a>&nbsp;</strong>service implementation&nbsp;for AERIN, was getting&nbsp;AERIN.com&nbsp;to launch, within aggressive timeline expectations; communications had to be streamlined across multiple AERIN partners. <span class=\"netamorphosis\">neta</span> provided best-in-class project and <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/performance-management/\"><strong>performance management</strong></a>, supplemental wireframes to guide graphic design in accordance with Demandware requirements and functional specification to elevate the end-to-end AERIN.com experience. Once teams and deliverables were supported, and the implementation was in motion, <span class=\"netamorphosis\">neta</span> shifted gears to help AERIN execute Demandware’s ‘link cartridge’ partners required for launch, including payment processor/fraud software, OMS (Order Management System) and its fulfillment center. This process, which is part of our technology service offering&nbsp;, included the development of detailed business and technical requirements specified for the DW integration and vendor negotiations. <span class=\"netamorphosis\">neta</span> served as the UAT&nbsp;lead prior to launch and the over-arching timeline &amp; project management. As the AERIN.com launch approached, <span class=\"netamorphosis\">neta</span> adapted programming specification documentation into internal AERIN training guides that would help bring future in-house resources up to speed efficiently in order to process orders and administer AERIN’s eCommerce operation.</p>"
