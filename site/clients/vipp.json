At the time VIPP (which in Danish is the ‘opening and closing’ of the pedal bin in Danish), was and still is the equivalent of the <em>Rolls-Royce</em> of trash bins, retailing 3-4x higher than its closest competitor, <em>simplehuman</em>.</p><h2>Planting the Danish flag of the Rolls-Royce of trash bins in the U.S.</h2><p>n e t a was retained by VIPP’s Head of Sales, the grandson of the inventor of the world’s first pedal bin, Holger Egelund, to carve out a US market entry <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/omnichannel/\"><strong>Omnichannel</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Strategy</strong></a> and strategic partner implementation that would achieve dramatic sales growth and significantly heighten VIPP’s visibility in the US. As VIPP was not yet ready to establish its <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/ecommerce/\"><strong>eCommerce</strong><strong> strategy</strong> </a>within the US market at the time of market entry, stateside, which for us was thinking outside of the box; so we shifted our thinking towards strategic wholesale partners, eCommerce distribution partners and key marketing events (both physical and digital). To get started, we conducted a deep dive to first understand VIPP’s 76+ year old brand heritage, and the ways in which to most deeply resonate its narrative within the US design community. We coupled our deep dive into the brand with gaining a comprehensive understanding of both US and Danish VIPP operations to gauge the direction of our <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/performance-management/\"><strong>performance management</strong></a> in regards to scale parameters and what could ultimately support US market growth through <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/omnichannel/\"><strong>omnichannel</strong></a>. Our operational discovery, entailed a full product assortment review factoring in margin opportunity (and all shipping logistics), US shipping logistics from a fulfillment perspective, as well as, design convictions to develop ideal distribution target materials.</p>"
