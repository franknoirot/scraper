For ease of URL entry, we shortened the full Suite New York to Suite NY, placing&nbsp;at the masthead of an eCommerce-enabled quickship program that shipped direct from vendor warehouses, as well as, SNY’s own warehouse that&nbsp;was supported by a custom LAMP (<em>Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)</em> platform where we devised both business and technical requirements in our <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/cms-implementation/\"><strong>CMS implementation</strong></a>. As eCommerce was a new channel at Suite NY, <span class=\"netamorphosis\">neta</span>&nbsp;created an <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/ecommerce/\"><strong>eCommerce strategy</strong></a> and subsequently shepherded the strategy as an integrated team member with Suite NY’s showroom sales people and vendors. We also structured vendor partner and fulfillment agreements for 1<sup>st</sup> time <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/ecommerce/\"><strong>eCommerce</strong></a> European vendors who were reticent to explore the possibility of selling ‘showroom’ product online in fear of losing cachet.</p><p>The design and custom development of suiteny.com took 12 months from 1<sup>st</sup> comp through to order fulfillment and end-to-end UAT. For <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/ux-design/\"><strong>design</strong></a>, <span class=\"netamorphosis\">neta</span> provided detailed wireframes and <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/content-creation/\"><strong>created all content</strong></a>, including photo shoot orchestration, website&nbsp;art direction, and project management. Given breadth of assortment and as a budget control, we also advocated for and devised a vendor-generated asset program that would adhere to suiteny.com’s new high quality image requirements for enhanced zoom and image enlarge capabilities.</p>"
