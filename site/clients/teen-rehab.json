In most instances of teens that develop addiction to substance abuse, the strain, uncertainty and erosion of support and coping mechanisms, can lead to the exacerbation of problems that teens and their families are confronting in growing numbers.</p><p>In collaborative partnership with a teen mental health and recovery expert visionary, we constructed teenrehab.org to serve as a non-affiliated informational web site that makes broadly available, necessary information with regard to treatment, research and clinical studies, trigger mechanisms, and warning signs to help those struggling with addiction and family members to begin to chart a course for recovery and to stem the tide of the overwhelming crisis facing our nation struggling with addiction that currently afflicts our young people and their futures.</p><p><strong>Impact of Addiction on Special Populations Adolescents (12 to 17 years old)</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/opioid-addiction-disease-facts-figures.pdf\"><strong>276,000</strong></a> adolescents are current nonmedical users of pain relievers, with 122,000 having an addiction to prescription pain relievers.</li><li>An estimated <a href=\"https://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/opioid-addiction-disease-facts-figures.pdf\"><strong>21,000</strong></a> adolescents used heroin in the past year, and an estimated 5,000 were current heroin users.
