Zen3 is a pioneered process for duplicating exosomes (exosomes = tiny messengers found naturally throughout the body that transfers unique data from one skin cell to another). While researchers are studying how exosomes help grow and regenerate specific types of tissue; Catherine Enright, sister of the CEO of Biotech Research &amp; Development in NC, believed this breakthrough technology had a cosmetic application. And, while the possibilities are endless, a universal anti-aging moisturizer could be conceived for women of all ages, skin types and origins.</p><p>Although Catherine, who had a background steeped in luxury branding certainly recognized the trend of simplification tied to multi-functional beauty products that was beginning to counter the personalization trend of years prior, the largest question loomed, was the all-in-one concept viable?</p>"
