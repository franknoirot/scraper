Demand for quality treatment also quadrupled within the past decade, attributed to the national opioid epidemic as drug overdose become <a href=\"https://www.newportacademy.com/resources/mental-health/teens-social-media-addiction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>the leading cause of accidental death</strong></a> in the United States in 2015, combined with the increasing prevalence of new disorders such as cell phone and <a href=\"https://www.newportacademy.com/resources/mental-health/teens-social-media-addiction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>social media addiction</strong></a> impacting adolescents today. Enter Newport Academy. Newport Academy, established in 2008, is a pioneer in the adolescent and young adult mental health&nbsp;treatment space. In addition to their cutting edge Residential Treatment Programs, they opened one of the first <a href=\"https://www.newportacademy.com/programs/day-schools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>recovery&nbsp;high schools</strong></a> in the United States. Founded by Jamison and his family, Newport Academy has built a comprehensive treatment alternative to teen rehabilitation.</p><h2>Effectively communicating the highest level of quality care within a competitive space.</h2><p>Given a heavy focus on digital marketing within the teen rehab space, <span class=\"netamorphosis\">netamorphosis</span> was initially retained to strengthen a digital platform re-positioning&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/strategy/\">strategy</a>,</strong> preceding a significant website re-design effort that was already underway with other 3rd Party partners. However, through the course of our 8-week discovery and subsequent <strong><a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/omnichannel/\">omnichannel </a></strong>delivery, we uncovered inefficient resources in the realms of <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/seo-services/\"><strong>SEO services</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/maintenance-hosting/\"><strong>Maintenance &amp; Hosting</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/ux-design/\"><strong>Design</strong></a>. While we first focused on migrating the hosting and development to a valued and trusted partner relationship within the ‘neta network’ through tactful <a href=\"https://netamorphosis.com/services/cms-implementation/\"><strong>CMS implementation</strong></a>, we proposed that, in the realms of both 3<sup>rd</sup> Party SEO and Design partners, that if we matched existing financial planning budgets, we could produce better results.</p>"
