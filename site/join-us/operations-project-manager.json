  "body": "<p>We are considered digital pioneers…we get excited by new technology, new ways to communicate and leading the ways that businesses captivate their audiences. We believe in the power of the group, and that an empowered, trusted and an open team format works better than one that’s constricted by hierarchy or the silho’ effect.&nbsp; We work hard and play right, and counter to traditional digital agency culture, we prioritize healthy living within the hustle of delivering cutting edge digital platforms.&nbsp; We are bound by our diversification of work subject matter, and the reality that at our core we are builders.&nbsp; You will contribute to the evolution of the healthcare industry, the way that we engage with the arts, the way that we personalize fashion and entertainment as self-expression, the way that we nourish ourselves and continue to move the needle forward for inspired non-profits.</p><p>Our operations project managers are the people who ensure we consistently meet and exceed not only our client’s expectations, but those of the markets we penetrate and most importantly our own. This valued role works across our operational needs from helping to develop operational strategies to finances, filing and organization, workflow processes and day-to-day operations, from both internal and client operational capacities.</p>"
