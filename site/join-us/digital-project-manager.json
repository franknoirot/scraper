  "body": "<p>We are considered digital pioneers…we get excited by new technology, new ways to communicate and leading the ways that businesses captivate their audiences. We believe in the power of the group, and that an empowered, trusted and an open team format works better than one that’s constricted by hierarchy or the silho’ effect.&nbsp; We work hard and play right, and counter to traditional digital agency culture, we prioritize healthy living within the hustle of delivering cutting edge digital platforms.&nbsp; We are bound by our diversification of work subject matter, and the reality that at our core we are builders.</p><p>Our Digital Project Managers are the people who ensure we consistently meet and exceed not only our client’s expectations, but also those of the markets we penetrate and, most importantly, our own standards. They coordinate every deliverable we ship: strategies, market research, investor pitch decks, concepts, logos, stunning videos and media, photography, tech builds and best-in-class digital platforms. You will contribute to the evolution of the healthcare industry, the way that we engage with the arts, the way that we personalize fashion as self-expression, the way that we nourish ourselves and continue to move the needle forward for inspired non-profits.</p>"
